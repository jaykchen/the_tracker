            "url": "https://github.com/shravan20/flare.ts/issues/13",
            "body": "# Summary:\r\nCreate a comprehensive MathUtils utility library that offers a wide range of mathematical operations, both base and complex, to assist developers in performing various mathematical calculations within their applications. This library should include functions like acosh, acos, absolute, atanh, copySign, getExponent, max, pow, sin, cos, tan, cosec, sec, cot, sinh, tanh, toDegrees, toRadians, lcm, gcd, verifyMathExpression, isNumber, getAbsolutePrecised, getEpsilon, and potentially more.\r\n\r\n# Motivation\r\nMathematical operations are fundamental in software development, and having a centralized utility library will aid developers in performing complex mathematical calculations accurately and efficiently. This will not only improve code readability but also reduce redundant code and enhance application performance.\r\n\r\n# Utility Functions\r\nThe MathUtils utility should encompass a comprehensive set of mathematical functions, including, but not limited to:\r\n\r\n- Trigonometric functions: sin, cos, tan, cosec, sec, cot\r\n- Hyperbolic functions: sinh, tanh\r\n- Exponential and logarithmic functions: pow, log, exp\r\n- Basic arithmetic operations: add, subtract, multiply, divide\r\n- Advanced operations: acosh, acos, atanh, copySign, getExponent\r\n- Unit conversion functions: toDegrees, toRadians\r\n- Number properties: isNumber, isInteger, isPrime\r\n- Common mathematical operations: max, min, gcd, lcm\r\n- Precision handling: getAbsolutePrecised, getEpsilon\r\n- Error Handling: The utility should handle potential errors gracefully, providing clear error messages and ensuring robust error handling for invalid inputs or edge cases.\r\n\r\n# Documentation\r\nComprehensive documentation should accompany each utility function, detailing its purpose, usage, parameters, return values, and examples.\r\n\r\n# Expected Behavior\r\nDevelopers should be able to easily integrate the MathUtils utility into their projects, simplifying mathematical operations and improving code quality.",

This will enhance code reusability and improve code readability within the service.\r\n\r\n# Motivation\r\nRepetitive logic can lead to code duplication, decreased maintainability, and reduced readability. By centralizing these logics into utility methods, we can enhance code reuse, streamline codebase maintenance, and improve comprehension for developers working on the service.\r\n\r\n# Proposed Changes\r\n\r\nUtility Methods:\r\n- Identify repeated logics related to arrays, weak maps, JSON objects, and maps within the service.\r\n- Create utility methods that encapsulate these logics for each data type.\r\n\r\n# Testing:\r\n- Ensure thorough testing of the utility methods to validate their correctness and reliability.\r\n\r\n# Expected Outcome\r\nUpon successful implementation, the service will utilize utility methods for common logics on arrays, weak maps, JSON objects, and maps, resulting in a cleaner, more maintainable codebase.",

This would allow users to choose GraphQL instead of Axios for their HTTP requests. Ensure that this implementation does not break the current architecture and strictly adheres to clean code and clean architecture patterns. Type everything appropriately and use interfaces where necessary.\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior:**\r\n\r\n- Implement a configuration for Apollo GraphQL that mirrors the existing Axios HTTP client setup.\r\n- Ensure that this new Apollo GraphQL implementation integrates seamlessly into the existing project structure.\r\n- Maintain adherence to clean code and clean architecture principles.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots (if applicable):**\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n**Additional Information:**\r\n\r\n- Don't forget to write unit tests",

Put the value of ``AutoSelectServerUrl`` as ``true`` inside the Config.json file. After setting it to ``true``, the logout menu shows the subtext \"Log out at {url}\".\n\n2. Log out.\n\n3. Review the server selection screen.\n\n4. Log in, then log out again.\n\n5. Check the server selection screen.\n\n#### Expected behavior\n\nLogging out should not replace the server display name with the server url\n\n#### Observed behavior\n\nWhen you log out, the server display Name is replaced with the server url.\n\nAlso, when logged out, the url is entered in displayName field of the server information screen.\n\n\n----\nIf you're interested please comment here and come [join our \"Contributors\" community channel](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/tickets) on our daily build server, where you can discuss questions with community members and the Mattermost core team.

The user should have the option to retry fetching data with a \"Retry\" button or action.\r\n4. There should be an icon or visual cue accompanying the error message to quickly indicate the type of issue (e.g., a disconnected plug icon for internet issues).\r\n5. If possible, previously loaded data (if any) should still be displayed or cached to allow users to access some content even if the API fails momentarily.\r\n6. The rest of the UI should remain responsive and accessible even if there's an error on the home screen content.\r\n7.

Nice to meet you. \r\n\r\nRegard the function to add to Ivi frontend, check the \"To-Do-List\" on this link - https://github.com/unifyai/ivy/issues/1546\r\n\r\n- then select a subtask with a Tensorflow Linear Algebra, like \"eigh\" highlighted - \r\n![image](https://github.com/unifyai/ivy/assets/56492496/4f65b451-f243-4500-aceb-d73c26607540)\r\n \r\n- You should searcch for the function in Tensorflow website -\r\nhttps://www.tensorflow.org/quantum/tutorials/quantum_data\r\n\r\nthe native function looks like this-\r\n\r\ntf.linalg.eigh(\r\n      tf.einsum('ji,jk->ik', x_train_normalized, x_train_normalized))\r\n  return tf.einsum('ij,jk->ik', x_train_normalized, e_vectors[:,-n_components:]), \\\r\n    tf.einsum('ij,jk->ik', x_test_normalized, e_vectors[:, -n_components:]) \r\n\r\n- then start the implementation according Ivy documentation.\r\n\r\nIf you need more information, please ask more and if I could find the answer, good, or send as many questions to the contributing channel on Ivy discord chat.\r\n\r\nYou are welcomed!\r\n\r\n"

This issue proposes to optimize the code to improve its performance and efficiency. Specifically, the following changes could be made:\r\n\r\n* Use PySpark's built-in filter method instead of an if statement to remove unnecessary records from the DataFrame.\r\n* Use PySpark's select method to select only the necessary columns from the DataFrame, instead of converting the DataFrame to an RDD and then iterating over each row.\r\n* Use PySpark's withColumn method to add new columns to the DataFrame, instead of creating a new dictionary and appending it to a list.\r\n* Use PySpark's foreach method instead of foreachBatch to write the processed data directly to MongoDB, instead of using a separate method to write to MongoDB.\r\n\r\nThese changes will make the code more efficient and easier to read and maintain.\r\n",

However, multiprocessing can be resource-intensive and may not be the most efficient solution for this task. This issue proposes to explore the use of asynchronous programming instead of multiprocessing to improve the performance of subdomain generation from multiple sources. The goal is to reduce resource usage and improve the overall efficiency of the subdomain generation process. This issue will involve refactoring the existing code to use async and testing the performance improvements against the current implementation.",
